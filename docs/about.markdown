The Accidentals are an Edinburgh (UK) based amateur classical guitar ensemble who 
meet on a weekly basis in Sep-Dec and Jan-Apr on Monday evenings at the 
[Meadows Croquet pavillion](https://meadowscroquet.org.uk/club/find.php). 
There are no auditions but please do let us know if you would like to try us out
before trying out a session to see if it is your kind of thing. We are always 
looking for new players of all standards to join us, the only requirement is that 
you need to be able to read music.

We play a wide variety of music and a typical concert programme will see us playing 
a selection of Renaissance, Baroque, Classical, Romantic and 20th Century music as 
well as a selection of Spanish and Latin American music.

The Accidentals are a non-profit organisation but in order to cover our costs there 
is a termly fee of £75 (£37.50 for students) in order to cover room hire, tutor 
fees and the purchase of music. Please contact us by email if you wish any more 
information.
